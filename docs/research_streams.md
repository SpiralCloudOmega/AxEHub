# Research Streams

Keep the AxEThrill roadmap fresh with these feeds:

- **Papers We Love** – curated academic classics. Mirror repo: https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love
- **AlphaXiv** – conversational digest of the latest arXiv drops: https://alphaxiv.org
- **arXiv.org** – official feed; filter to `cs.AI`, `cs.RO`, `cs.LG`: https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent
- **Google Scholar Alerts** – configure topic alerts for “multi-agent orchestration”, “cybernetic UI”, etc.
- **OpenAI Research** – https://openai.com/research for platform roadmaps.

Drop key links into your manifest metadata (e.g. `metadata.related_papers`) so the backpack can surface them in the Streamlit catalogue.
